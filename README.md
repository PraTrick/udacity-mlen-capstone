## Capstone Project: Write an Algorithm for Identifying T-Shirt's Graphic Type

* Capstone Proposal: proposal.pdf
* Project Report: project_report.pdf
* Programming language: Python 2.7+
* **requirements** directory defines all the python modules required as the part of setup/startup
* Libraries: keras, tensorflow, cv2, numpy, pandas, sklearn, glob, tqdm, PIL, matplotlib
* Datasets are available in **dataset** branch, and is divided as follows:
	1. For training => **tshirtImages/train**
	2. For validation => **tshirtImages/valid**
	3. For testing => **tshirtImages/test**
* **vgg_16_bottleneck_features.py** and **resnet_50_bottleneck_features.py** to create and save bottleneck features
* **extract_bottleneck_features.py** to extract bottleneck features
